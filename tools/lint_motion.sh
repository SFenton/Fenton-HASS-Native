#   transition          `.transition(` in HassUI/App and HassUI/Features (in-place swaps only, listed below)
#   repeat-forever      `repeatForever` outside ArcSpinner and the pending pulse
#   state-colour        a state-driven `.background` / `.fill` / `.foregroundStyle` ternary in a component of motion-components.md
#                       whose file never uses stateColorTransition / stateForeground / stateColor / quickTransition
