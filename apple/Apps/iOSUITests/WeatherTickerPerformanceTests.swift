/// What the weather card's label ticker costs while it runs (`.agents/design/motion.md` §9 ticker exception,
/// `.agents/testing/apple/performance.md`, "Weather card ticker"; runner: `tools/ios_tickerperf.sh`).
///
/// The app records a `TickerRun` signpost interval for every run (`TickerLabel`). These tests measure ten seconds of a ticking
/// label with `XCTOSSignpostMetric` (the interval), `XCTCPUMetric` and, on iOS 26 and later, `XCTHitchMetric`, and compare the same
/// ten seconds with a label that fits (nothing moving). Simulator hitch ratios and GPU cost are false: the simulator runs only
/// with `TEST_RUNNER_FENTON_PERF_ON_SIMULATOR=1` (the runner sets it) and the numbers it gives are CPU. The device budgets are in
/// the performance doc; running on a physical phone needs the owner's say-so.
///
/// Budgets (asserted by the runner from the metrics' CPU time, recorded in the doc): the ticking card costs at most 10% of one core
/// more than the still card over ten seconds, and the hitch time ratio stays under 5 ms/s (Apple's "good").
