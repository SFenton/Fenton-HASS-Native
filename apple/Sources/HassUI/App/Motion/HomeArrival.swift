/// The state of a moment's entrance while it plays: today only Home's arrival after a sign-in (owner, 2026-10-17;
/// `.agents/design/direction-g.md`, "Launch and sign-in motion"). The sign-in layer lifts away while the house backdrop fades in
/// and settles, then the header, the status chips, the cards and the tab bar come in one after another, about 0.9 s in all.
///
/// One instance lives in the root and goes into the environment. Elements read ``isRevealed``; while no arrival is under way it
/// is true, so a relaunch, a reconnect or a tab switch animates nothing and the views keep their identity. Each element animates
/// itself with ``SwiftUICore/View/arrivalMotion(_:kind:index:)``, which is the identity when there is no instance in the
/// environment (galleries, previews). The root starts the arrival only while ``MotionPolicy`` says the moment has not played.
