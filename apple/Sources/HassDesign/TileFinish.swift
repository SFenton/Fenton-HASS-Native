///
/// Tinted glass is the family fill at 78% over a dark underlay, so the wallpaper tints it a little, with a lit hairline and
/// a soft top highlight (a faint shade at the bottom). Every state keeps the solid finish's meaning; the difference is edge
/// and depth, which answers "subtle, less childish" (owner, 2026-10-16) while the glanceable family-colour fill stays.
///
/// **No live blur.** The finish is built from translucency over the wallpaper (which is blurred once and cached), one
/// gradient and a hairline, never `.blur` or a material per tile, which cost GPU time and crashed the render server
/// (direction-g.md, Layers; performance.md).
///
/// **HIG.** Tiles are content-layer elements, so none uses Liquid Glass (HIG, Materials: "Don't use Liquid Glass in the
/// content layer"); translucency and a hairline stand in for a standard material. With Reduce Transparency or Increase
/// Contrast the finish is ``solid`` (HIG, Accessibility), see ``effective(_:reduceTransparency:increasedContrast:)``.
