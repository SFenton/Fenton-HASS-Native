# Settings: household pages (Admin, Special Device Modes, Guest Controls, Mach-E)

> **What:** the household topics under the Settings tab and the Admin sheets. **Read when:** changing `HassUI/Features/Settings/Household`, `HassCore/Settings` or `HouseholdSettingsConfig`.

## Web source

`ha-sfenton-react-dash@9ac2a46`: `src/pages/DashboardViewPage.tsx` `SettingsPage` (1944), `GuestControlsPage` (1948), `SpecialDeviceModesPage` (1964), `AdminPage` (2871), `AdminHashButton` / `LivingRoomPowerRecoveryButton` / `AdminPresenceOverrideGrid` (428-488), `ControlPage` for `mach-e`; `src/constants/portedDashboard.ts` (`ADMIN_*`, `SETTINGS_PAGE_ITEMS`, `GUEST_CONTROL_ITEMS`, `CONTROL_PAGES['mach-e']`); `src/components/hass/{PresenceOverrideCard,presenceOverrideState,SpecialDeviceModeCard,EntityActionCard}.tsx`; copy in `src/i18n/locales/en/pages/{settings,admin,specialDeviceModes,guests}.json`. Project spec: `plans/settings-household-spec.md`.

## Native

- Entities and copy: `HassCore/Config/HouseholdSettingsConfig.swift`. State and commands: `HassCore/Settings/HouseholdSettingsController.swift` (one per page), presence resolver `PresenceOverrideState.swift`.
- Pages: `HouseholdSettingsPageView(page:)` (a `ScrollView` of `SettingsSection`s, readable width 840 pt); `HouseholdSettingsDestination` wires it to the signed-in connection. Rows in `SettingsScreen` push it; ids `settings.topic.<admin|specialDeviceModes|guests|machE>` match the navigation shell's topic ids. Vacation and To-Do rows land with their own pages.
- Admin: Security Controls, Living Room Power Recovery (`automation.trigger`, no confirmation, as on the web), Relay Control Mode with the guest-mode `InlineAlert`, the two sheet openers (`GlassTile` `.navigate`), Show Specific Controls. Sheets (`.large`, drag indicator, Done) in every pose, never a split pane.
- Presence-Based Overrides sheet: 14 room tiles tinted by mode (an unavailable room stays openable at full contrast and says Unavailable; its detail disables the choices); a room pushes its four modes inside the sheet as `SelectableOptionRow`s, one column on phones and two where there is room (the web's 2x2 grid crowds an iPhone). Select sends `presence_based_lighting.set_automation_state` with `state` = `active` | `off` | `paused` | `quieted`.
- Toggles send explicit `turn_on` / `turn_off` from the shown state (`input_boolean`, `switch`; anything else through `homeassistant`), not the web's `homeassistant.toggle`. Toggles and presence modes are optimistic until Home Assistant confirms, the call fails, or 2 s pass (web `DEFAULT_OPTIMISTIC_REVERT_MS`).
- Mach-E tiles are `GlassStateTile`s (not buttons): the web gives them no action. Departure: Charge Status shows its value (the web hides it, leaving a tile with no information).
- HIG: Settings (grouped topics, push into detail), Toggles (`.isToggle` with On/Off), Sheets (Done, large detent for grids), Lists and tables (single choice with a checkmark and `.isSelected`).

## Tests

- Unit (`HouseholdSettingsTests`): config parity, presence resolver mapping, explicit on/off, optimistic confirm / revert / failure, unavailable entities ignored, relay warning rule, power recovery, Mach-E formatting.
- Hosted (`HouseholdSettingsViewTests`): every page live and unavailable at phone and iPad widths, sheets, detail, gallery, shared pieces, every SF Symbol exists, gallery recorder echo.
- Journeys (`HouseholdSettingsJourneyTests`): controls run in the debug gallery (`FENTON_GALLERY=household-settings`, `FENTON_GALLERY_HOUSEHOLD=<page>`, `FENTON_GALLERY_UNAVAILABLE=1`) on fixtures with a recording caller, so nothing in the house switches. The signed-in journey only opens each live page and audits Admin. Audits with the AX5 relaunch cover every page, both sheets and the presence detail.
