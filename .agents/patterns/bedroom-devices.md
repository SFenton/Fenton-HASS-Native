# Bedroom devices (wake light, bed sides)

> **What:** the Master Bedroom's Wake-Light Alarms and SleepyPod bed sides: tiles, sheets, alarm editors, the active alarm and the Tonight/All Nights prompt. **Read when:** placing these on a page, touching wake-light or bed alarms, or changing Solo Trip bed behavior.

## Using it

```swift
@State private var bedroom = BedroomDevices(store: connection.store, caller: connection, canEdit: user.isAdmin)

WakeLightTile(controller: bedroom.wakeLight) { sheet = .wakeLight(.alarms) }
ForEach(bedroom.beds, id: \.config.id) { bed in BedSideTile(controller: bed) { sheet = .bed(bed.config.side, .temperature) } }

.sheet(item: $sheet, onDismiss: { if let next = queued { queued = nil; sheet = next } }) { sheet in
    switch sheet {
    case let .wakeLight(tab): WakeLightSheet(devices: bedroom, initialTab: tab) { side in queued = .bed(side, .alarms) }
    case let .bed(side, tab): BedSideSheet(devices: bedroom, side: side, initialTab: tab)
    }
}
.hassSheet(.page)
```

"Open Linked-Device Alarm Editor" closes the wake-light sheet and asks the host to open that bed on Alarms; queue it until the first sheet is dismissed (see `BedroomGallery`). Create one `BedroomDevices` per page, not per tile, so both sheets share pending edits.

## Behavior

- **Home Assistant wins.** Every control shows its change at once and gives way to the live state when it confirms, when a call fails or is refused, or after its revert time (wake light 8 s; bed power, target and stages 30 s; snooze/stop 10 s; alarm lists 30 s or the schedule echo). Bed entities keep their last state for 10 s of unavailability.
- **Wake-light commands** go through `wake_light.command` with `return_response`; `accepted` and `no_change` count as success (`no_change` drops the edit quietly), anything else rolls back and shows the copy for its error code, 10 s without a reply is a transport error. Configuration commands run one at a time; Stop Wake-Light Episode skips the queue. A revision conflict on the edited alarm offers "Open Latest Alarm, Replace Draft".
- **Bed target.** The dial commits on release (no debounce). During a stage it sets tonight's target, then asks Tonight or All Nights; All Nights also sets that stage's `input_number`. Outside a stage it calls the outside-schedule script. A stage change drops a pending target and the question.
- **Stage steppers** batch presses for 300 ms, then `input_number.set_value` plus an MQTT schedule rewrite; stepping the running stage goes through tonight's target and the question.
- **Bed alarms** batch for 450 ms, then publish the side's full alarm list on `sleepypod/eight-pod/cmd/set-schedules`. Saving or deleting first sets the wake-light link for that day and time and saves nothing if that is refused.
- **"Add to <bed>"** (new weekly wake alarms) creates missing bed alarms and turns links on; turned off, it turns existing links off. It never deletes bed alarms. One-time alarms send `bed_sides`.
- **Solo Trip.** The home resident's side controls the whole bed through `script.household_away_command` (`sleepypod_command`: `set_power`, `set_outside_level`, `set_tonight_level`, `set_stage_level`, `replace_alarms`, `snooze_alarm`, `stop_alarm`); the traveler's side is read-only.
- **Layout.** Bed sheet: hero (dial, power, hint, active alarm) beside the tabs only where a split is allowed (iPad and unfolded Duo in landscape, sheet ≥ 640 pt); stacked everywhere else. Alarm day pages and editors push inside the sheet. Tabs become a menu at accessibility text sizes.
- **Contrast.** The app accent (light blue) fails as text on the cards: links use `HassTokens.Ink.primary`, Stop and Delete use `BedroomStyle.danger` filled (deep red, white label ~6:1, not system red at 3.6:1) and Snooze and the off power button `BedroomStyle.off` (filled; a bordered gray fill fails against the card); Add, Save and selected chips use `BedroomStyle.action`, a deeper blue (white on the accent is 2.5:1).
- **Accessibility.** Dial handle reads "Stephen's Bed target level, +3" and adjusts by one step; stage rows are adjustable; confirmation dialogs guard turning a side off and deleting alarms; every control is ≥ 44 pt.
- **Departures from web.** SleepyPod climate mode only (the legacy Free Sleep path and its Settings tab are not ported); no debug MQTT topic; the 3 s target confirmation hold is dropped because the dial commits on release; tile titles use the bed name, not "Your Side"; the wake-light bar titles drop the room name ("Master Bedroom Wake-Light Alarms" clipped at AX5); the traveler's side shows no disabled power button during a Solo Trip, only the "Away · Read Only" hint.
- **Tests.** `HassCoreTests/BedroomContractTests.swift`, `HassCoreTests/BedroomControllerTests.swift`, hosted renders in `HassUITests/BedroomViewTests.swift`, journeys and audits in `Apps/iOSUITests/BedroomJourneyTests.swift` against the gallery (`FENTON_GALLERY_SCENARIO`, `FENTON_GALLERY_SHEET`, `FENTON_GALLERY_TAB`).
