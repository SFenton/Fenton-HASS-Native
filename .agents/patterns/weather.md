# Weather card and sheet

> **What:** the Home weather card, its 24-hour carousel and the Weather sheet, plus the logic under them. **Read when:** changing anything in `HassUI/Features/Home/Weather` or `HassCore/Weather`.

Web source: `ha-sfenton-react-dash@f5a7bf9` `src/components/hass/WeatherSummary.tsx` (card and sheet), `useWeatherForecasts.ts`, `weatherPresentation.ts`, `weatherDayBriefing.ts` + `useWeatherDayBriefing.ts`, `precipitationTimeline.ts`, `WeatherRail.tsx`, `WeatherPrecipitationTile.tsx`, `WeatherHourlyMetricTiles.tsx`, and `i18n/locales/en/modals/weather.json` (the copy deck, ported as `WeatherCopy`).

## Pieces

| Piece | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Forecast store | `HassCore/Weather/WeatherForecastStore` | One shared instance per card. Port of the web cache: 5 min TTL, 5 s retry doubling to the TTL on a dropped connection, refetch when the weather entity changes (`revision(of:)` stands in for `last_updated`), hourly entries pruned when their hour passes, never blanks while refreshing, phases idle/loading/ready/empty/error. A request that never answers (HAKit drops unanswered `shouldRetry: false` requests across a reconnect) times out after 20 s and counts as a dropped connection. |
| Disk snapshot | `WeatherForecastDiskCache` | Caches directory, keyed by server, cleared on sign-out. Restored in the store's `init`, so a cold launch draws the carousel before any network work. The restored copy is never treated as fresh. |
| Presentation | `WeatherPresentation`, `WeatherFormat`, `WeatherCondition*`, `WeatherHighlights`, `WeatherRails` | Direct ports; thresholds and marker maths match the web tests. |
| Today briefing | `WeatherDayBriefingGenerator`, `WeatherBriefingPlanner` | Structured copy references rendered by `WeatherBriefingRenderer`; frozen once per local day at or after 00:01 and stored in the disk snapshot. |
| Card | `WeatherSummaryCard` (wiring) + `WeatherCardContent` | Wiring: appear/disappear, entity revision, websocket ready, scene phase, 30 s briefing check. The gallery injects `\.weatherForecastStore` and `\.weatherForecastCaller`. |
| Carousel | `WeatherPagedCarousel`, `WeatherCarouselPaging` | Pages of whole hours (`scrollTargetBehavior(.paging)`). Hours per page come from the size class and text size, not from measuring (a measured width never reached state in the hosted test host); hour labels scale freely (a `minimumScaleFactor` made the AX5 audit flag them). The page indicator keeps small dots inside a 44 pt tall element. Regular layouts add 44 pt Previous/Next buttons (the web shows them for pointer devices); every layout has an adjustable page indicator element. |
| Sheet | `WeatherSheet` and the `Weather*Panel` views | Dark appearance, condition gradient as the sheet background, panels as a darkening wash (no blur, so Reduce Transparency changes nothing). |
| Highlights | `WeatherHighlightsPanel` on `DynamicGridLayout` | Wide tiles `gridSpan(2)`; the grid minimum cell width scales with text size so it reflows to one column at AX5. |
| Gallery | `Gallery/WeatherGallery` (`FENTON_GALLERY=weather`) | `FENTON_GALLERY_WEATHER_CONDITION`, `_NIGHT`, `_STATE=loading|error|empty`, `_OPEN`, `_NOAQI`, `_FILL=<points>` (padding so the page scrolls). Debug only. |

## Accessibility rules

- The card's header is laid out as option D ([weather card header](../design/weather-card-header.md)): glyph, condition (a [ticker](ticker.md) when it overflows) and today's high and low on the left, the numeral with its chevron on the right (the one button); accessibility sizes, or a range wider than its column, stack the condition and range under the glyph and numeral row. `WeatherSymbols.leadingInsets` pulls each glyph left so its ink meets the label's edge (`WeatherViewTests.leadingInsetTableMatchesTheRenderedInk`).
- The card's header is the one button ("Open seven-day weather forecast. Rain, 72°F"); the rest of the card also opens the sheet by tap, but only the header is a button for assistive technology. Hours, today's high and low and the page indicator are separate elements.
- Hours, days and tiles speak the web's aria-labels (`7 PM Rain 62°F`, `Mon precipitation 0.1 in 40%`, `Wind 9 mph; Gusts 14 mph; From west-southwest, 250 degrees`). Charts and gauges are hidden; their tile speaks the series.
- Mode buttons are labelled "Conditions", "Precipitation", "Wind" with an `isSelected` trait; the web's label ("Conditions conditions") reads awkwardly with a selected state.
- Text colours are `HassTokens.Ink.onDark` / `onDarkSecondary` over gradients whose lightest stop is at least 5.6:1 against white (checked by `WeatherViewTests.backdropsAreDarkEnoughForWhiteText`).
- Reduce Motion: no page, rail or compass animation, and the rain/snow decoration is a still frame. Reduce Transparency: no decoration.

## Departures from the web

- SF Symbols (multicolor) replace the custom SVG glyphs; night variants only for the current condition, from `sun.sun`.
- No animated atmosphere beyond slow rain/snow streaks; clouds, stars and glow are still.
- The Today briefing is stored in the disk snapshot instead of `localStorage`.
- No navigation subtitle: the bar subtitle measured 4.1:1 over the gradient (iPhone audit, 2026-10-13), and the hero already shows "72°" and the condition. The title stays the system "Weather".
- Charts are plain bars (HIG: Charting data), not Swift Charts, so every axis label can scale with Dynamic Type.

## Tests

`apple/Tests/HassCoreTests/Weather*Tests.swift` (store, presentation, briefing, chart maths, highlights, parsing), `apple/Tests/HassUITests/WeatherViewTests.swift` (symbols, paging, labels, every state rendered, wiring in a live window), `apple/Apps/iOSUITests/WeatherJourneyTests.swift` (gallery journeys and audits at default and AX5; run on iPhone, Duo and iPad with `tools/ios_uitest.sh`).
