- States covered: default (Overdue), profile, profile-location-off, upcoming, expired-food, loading, error, offline, three empty tabs, vacation, vacation-food, guest, steph, sign-out-alert, ax5. Detent: `.full` only (large).
- Motion: tab-crossfade (0.15 s, none under Reduce Motion), chore-complete (list animation). Transitions: present and dismiss, sign-out alert.
- Devices: iPhone, Duo folded, unfolded portrait and landscape, iPad portrait and landscape (full-height form sheet).
