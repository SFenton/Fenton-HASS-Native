# Lights overview (modal)
> **What:** the sheet Home's Lights chip opens: rooms with lights as status cards (Lights On, Lights Off) that push the room's lights. **Read when:** you change `RoomOverviewSheet` for `.lights`, a room card, the sheet title or subtitle, or need a reference for the room overview sheets.
