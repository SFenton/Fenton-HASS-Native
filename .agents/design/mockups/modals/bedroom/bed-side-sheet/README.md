# Bed side sheet (modal)
> **What:** the SleepyPod bed sheet: level dial, power, hint and alarm card above four bottom tabs (Temperature, Special Modes, Alarms, Status). **Read when:** you change `BedSideSheet`, the bed dial mapping, the alarm card, Solo Trip behaviour or the two-column landscape layout.
