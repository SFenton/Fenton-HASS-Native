# Direction G build plan

> **What:** the phases, components and verification for moving the app to [direction G](direction-g.md). **Read when:** picking up any direction G work, or touching a file a G phase owns.

## Update 2026-10-14

- **Go-ahead:** Stephen: "Once chores thread is done you are permitted to proceed with the design refactor." Then, a minute later: "Sorry, Chores *and* Media. Once those are done, begin." Then (04:51Z): "In the meantime, you're free to begin work on what you can, so that once that work goes in you have a strong base to start from." So Phase 1 is being built now on `claude/project-thread-06krou`, and it stays off the files Chores (#35) and Media (#39) change. Its PR opens once both have merged.
- **Already merged:** App chrome (#44, `c5240c3`-era main) and the performance pass. The pieces Phase 1 restyles exist on main:
  - `HassUI/Common/HouseBackdrop.swift`: a cached, Core Image–blurred photo through `ImagePipeline`. The G scrim and the dark-only look go here.
  - `HassDesign/HassModal.swift`: `HassModal`, `SheetCloseItem` and `SheetCloseButton`.
  - `HassDesign/HeaderEdgeFade.swift`.
  - `HassUI/Common/ModalTabBar.swift`: it already has a `.bottom` placement reserved for this direction, so the bottom section bar is a restyle plus a default change.
  - `HassDesign/Loading/ContentGate.swift`: the spinner it shows becomes `ArcSpinner`.
  - `HassUI/Common/RoomOverview/*`: the shared room chip modal, with tints in `RoomOverviewStyle`. The colour families go there.
- **Phase 2 (shell), 2026-10-14:** `AppSection` has four cases; Settings lives in `AccountSheet` behind the profile avatar (Settings and its topics push inside the sheet; Sign Out sits behind an alert). The iPad flyout lists the four tabs, then Quick Links, which presents the sheet. Sign-in is dark with `PrimaryButtonStyle`. Recorded departures:
  - **Quick Links on iPhone stays the trailing tab page**, not a circle that presents the sheet: iOS 26 draws a `Tab(role: .search)` inside the bar unless its page is searchable, and selects it even when the selection binding refuses (measured 2026-10-14).
  - **No split page is left:** Settings was `OnDemandSplitStack`'s only adopter. The component and its hosted tests stay for the next list/detail page.
  - **People at Home and Your Summary** wait on the Daily Report port.
- **Colour families and the arc spinner** (Stephen, 2026-10-14) are part of Phase 1. See direction-g.md.
- **Arc spinner sweep (Phase 1 step 2):** `ArcSpinner` replaced the system spinner in `ContentGate` and every `ProgressView()` spinner outside the open PRs. Titled spinners keep their words with `.progressViewStyle(.arc)` (`ArcProgressViewStyle`); a determinate `ProgressView(value:)` keeps its bar. The Chores and Cameras files skipped while #35 and #39 were open (`DonetickTaskSheet`, `TodoListSection`, `CameraLiveView`) were swept after they merged (2026-10-14).

## Phase 1 status (2026-10-14)

Built on `claude/project-thread-06krou`, one commit per step, in the order the coordinator set:

| Step | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Arc spinner | `ArcSpinner`, `ArcProgressViewStyle` (`.progressViewStyle(.arc)`) | Every `ProgressView()` spinner outside the open PRs; skips listed above. `ContentGate` builds the arc only while it shows. |
| Palette | `HassTokens.Palette`, `Ink.warning/actionFill/badge`, `Surface`, radii 22/26 | Raw values with contrast tests (`HassTokensTests`); light-appearance values kept. Accent colour follows the G tint in dark. |
| Wallpaper | `HouseBackdrop`, `HouseBackdropStyle` | Blur 20, saturation 1.1, scale 1.06, G's scrim; `preferredColorScheme(.dark)` on the signed-in shell. |
| Module | `.module(.thin/.dense)` (`HassDesign/Module.swift`) | Content layer only; Reduce Transparency makes it opaque. `navigationGlass(in:)` is the navigation-layer counterpart. |
| Tiles | `TileFaceStyle`, `GlassTile(family:isError:)`, `BrightnessTile` | Off, lit, filled, tinted (no family yet) and error faces; dragger bubble, lift, 10% haptic. Filled progress shades the part still to go (a white band failed contrast). |
| Chips | `StatusChipButton(family:)`, `ColorFamily.chipFill/chipGlyph`, `ColorFamily.climate` | Web colours; AQI-coloured glyph is a follow-up. |
| Section bar | `ModalTabBar` on glass, `modalTabBar(placement: .bottom)` by default | Climate and Media Remote still place it inline at the top; their lanes move them. |
| Primary button | `PrimaryButton`, `PrimaryButtonStyle` | |
| Gallery | `ComponentGallery` page `direction-g` (`DirectionGGallery`), `DirectionGJourneyTests` | Names, targets, taps, drag, audits (top and lower sections, AX5), sheet bar at the bottom; iPhone, Duo and iPad. |

## Starting point on main (surveyed 2026-10-13, before the merges above)

| Area | Today | G needs |
|---|---|---|
| Tokens (`HassDesign/HassTokens.swift`) | Spacing, three radii, web-derived tints, `Ink` (label, danger, action) that adapt to light and dark | One dark palette: tint text `#409CFF`, tint fill `#0071E3`, red `#FF6961`, orange `#FFB340`, badge `#D93025`, owner hues, heat `#CD5401`, cool `#2C8E98`. Radii 22 (tile), 26 (module), 50pt capsule. Material specs. |
| Appearance | Follows the system; nothing sets a colour scheme | Pages are always dark on the wallpaper. Sheets are dark in v1 (see Decisions). |
| Shell (`MainTabView`, `AppSection`) | `TabView` with five sections, Settings is a tab; iPad flyout | Four tabs plus a Quick Links glass circle; Settings moves into the Account sheet behind the Profile avatar. The App chrome thread is already building the tab bar, Quick Links and profile button. |
| Page background | Per page; the App chrome thread is adding `HouseBackdrop` and a header fade | One cached, pre-blurred wallpaper bitmap with G's scrim on every tab root and pushed page. |
| Tiles (`GlassTile`, `BrightnessTile`) | Material tiles with a tint and wash; `BrightnessTile` already does tap to toggle and horizontal drag for brightness | Same behaviour, G looks: dark off, warm lit tile with dark ink, other devices filled with their colour family, red error state, % bubble and lift while dragging, 10% haptic ticks. |
| Status chips (`StatusPill`, `StatusRail`) | App chrome thread is turning them into tinted pills | Capsule with glyph, title and state; owner tint when active. |
| Sheet chrome | About 20 hand-rolled copies; App chrome thread is consolidating into `HassModal`, `.hassSheet()`, `SheetCloseItem` and a top `ModalTabBar` | Close x trailing; Cancel x leading with a blue check trailing on edit sheets; sections in a **bottom** glass segmented control. |
| Thermostat dial (`HassDesign/ThermostatDial`) | Already G's signature dial | Keep as is. Bed and humidifier dials reuse its geometry. |
| Section pickers (`SheetTabPicker`) | Top segmented control, menu at accessibility sizes | Bottom glass section bar (same fallback to a menu at accessibility sizes). |
| Deployment target | iOS 17 | Liquid Glass on iOS 26 and later; `.ultraThinMaterial` capsules on 17–25. |

## Decisions I'm taking (defaults, change any of them)

1. **Build on the App chrome thread's pieces, not beside them.** Its `HouseBackdrop`, `HassModal`, `.hassSheet()`, `SheetCloseItem`, tab bar, profile button and pill chips get restyled to G. No second set of components.
2. **Sections move to the bottom.** The chrome thread's `ModalTabBar` sits at the top. G puts sections in a bottom glass control, as in the mockups Stephen approved, so `ModalTabBar` gains bottom placement and every sheet switches to it.
3. **Dark everywhere in v1.** Pages are dark by design. Sheets ship dark too, since that is what the mockups show; light-appearance sheets are a follow-up.
4. **Settings leaves the tab bar** and is pushed inside the Account sheet. On macOS it becomes the Settings window (⌘,).
5. **The open questions in direction-g.md keep their mockup defaults** until Stephen answers.
6. **One look change per screen, no behaviour changes.** G threads restyle; they don't change what a control does, except where G names a new behaviour (the % bubble, Hub and Fan pop-up menus, garage button states, the "Updating" pill).

## Phases

### Phase 0: now, no code
- This plan and [direction-g.md](direction-g.md), text only (no images; the repo is public).
- The design skill installer (`tools/install_design_skills.sh`) and its `.gitignore` lines go in the same PR. app-designer-pro stays uncommitted.

### Phase 1: foundation (one thread, starts when App chrome and Performance have merged)
Everything later phases need, shown in `ComponentGallery` with snapshot tests and screenshots against the mockups.

| Piece | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `HassTokens` G palette, radii, type ramp | `HassDesign/HassTokens.swift` | Replace `Ink.action` uses with the G tint. Keep names stable where callers exist. |
| `Wallpaper` | Extends `HouseBackdrop` | Decode once at screen size, blur and saturate once (Core Image), cache in memory and on disk next to the image cache from #36. Draw the scrim gradient on top. Never a live `.blur`. |
| `.module(.thin / .dense)` | `HassDesign` | `rgba(28,28,30,.55)` with a 30pt background blur, or dense `rgba(20,20,22,.78)` for red and orange text. 26pt corners, no rim. Content layer only, never `.glassEffect`. |
| Sheet ground | `HassModal` | `#1C1C1E` ground, `#2C2C2E` cells; the presenting page scales back and dims (system behaviour). |
| Toolbar circles | `SheetCloseItem` and siblings | Close, Cancel, Confirm (filled `#0071E3` check), Back, Profile avatar. 44pt glass circles. |
| `SectionBar` | Replaces `SheetTabPicker` and the top `ModalTabBar` | Bottom glass segmented control; symbols only at five segments; hides empty sections; cross-fade with no layout jump; menu at accessibility sizes. |
| `PrimaryButton` | `HassDesign` | 50pt capsule, `#0071E3` with white label, or an owner hue with dark text. |
| Tile restyle | `GlassTile`, `BrightnessTile` | Off, lit, family-fill and error faces (colour families in direction-g.md); equal heights per grid row; chevron only when it opens something. Dragger adds the % bubble, lift and 10% haptics. |
| `LightSlab` | New, from `BrightnessTile` | Full-width slab for a room's lights, and the 168pt brightness slab in the light detail. |
| Status chip restyle | The chrome thread's pill | Web chip colours (direction-g.md), horizontal scroll, Duo stops 24pt short of the hinge. |
| Inset lists | `SettingsSection`, list rows | 26pt radius on pages, 52/60pt rows, inset hairlines; explanations inside the card on the wallpaper. |
| Loading | With #36's `ContentGate` | One centred `ArcSpinner` on the wallpaper with nothing saved; the "Updating" glass pill by Profile with a snapshot. |
| `ArcSpinner` | `HassDesign` | The web's arc: a `Circle` track at 22% plus a 25%-trimmed arc with an angular gradient from 72% to 96%, rotating linearly every 0.82 s. Sizes 44, 20 and 16; tints from `foregroundStyle`. Replaces every `ProgressView()` spinner. Half speed with Reduce Motion. |

Gate to leave Phase 1: compiles on the Mac, `HassDesignTests` and `HassUITests` pass, the rendered contrast audit (`RenderedContrast.swift`) passes on the wallpaper and in sheets, Reduce Transparency swaps materials for opaque fills, and gallery screenshots sit beside the mockups in the thread.

### Phase 2: shell (same thread as Phase 1, or right after it)
- Four tabs plus Quick Links circle, Chores overdue badge, Profile avatar into the Account sheet (People at Home, Your Summary, Settings pushed inside, Sign Out with an iOS 26 alert).
- Pushed pages: glass Back circle, large title, tab bar hidden only where the page has its own bottom toolbar.
- iPad flyout lists the four tabs then Quick Links. Duo unfolded keeps each half its own column.
- Login screen (`n1-signin`).

### Phase 3: pages, five lanes in parallel
Each lane restyles its screens against its mockups, uses only Phase 1 pieces, and posts before and after screenshots per device as it goes.

| Lane | Mockups | Code |
|---|---|---|
| **Home** | n1 home, weather, daily report, Quick Links, Account and Settings; n2 lights, light detail, security, doors, climate, occupancy and air quality sheets, cameras | `Features/Home/*` (HomeScreen, StatusRail, CameraGrid, WeatherSummaryCard, GuestPresenceSection), `HassUI/Common/RoomOverview/*` (the chip sheets, LightGroupTile; added 2026-10-15), `Features/Cameras/*`, `Features/Settings/*`, `Features/Rooms/QuickLinksSheet` |
| **Security and Climate** | n3 | `Features/Security/*`, `Features/Climate/*`, `Controls/Thermostat/*`. Hub mode and Fan become `Picker(.menu)`; garage buttons get Sending, Opening, Closing and Error. |
| **Rooms and devices** | n4 rooms, room pages, fan, purifier, bath fan, humidifier, grill, wake light, bed | `Features/Rooms/*`, `Features/RoomDevices/*`, `Features/Bedroom/*` |
| **Media and outdoors** | n4 media, remote, custom lights, sprinklers | `Features/Media/*`, `Features/MediaRemote/*`, `Features/CustomLights/*`, `Features/Sprinklers/*` |
| **Chores, Food and Vacuums** | n5 and n6 | `Features/Chores/*`, `Features/Vacation/*`, `HassDesign/FilterSheet`, `FloatingActionBar`, `Features/Food/*`, `Features/Inventory/*`, `Features/Vacuums/*` |

Shared helpers lanes add for each other (use them, don't copy): `HassDesign/SheetSubtitle.swift` (`.sheetSubtitle(_:)`, a sheet's one-line subtitle: the system navigation subtitle on iOS 26 and later, none earlier; never a custom principal title or `minimumScaleFactor`).

The fifth lane is the largest; if it runs long it splits into Chores and Vacation, and Food, Inventory and Vacuums.

### Phase 4: platforms and polish
- iPad 4-column grids, form and page sheets, flyout. Duo unfolded once the Duo simulator can unfold again (blocked today).
- macOS sidebar, toolbar Quick Links, Settings window, panels for the thermostat and remote (only if a Mac target is in scope by then).
- Light-appearance sheets.
- A full-app pass of the contrast audit, Dynamic Type at AX5, VoiceOver order and Reduce Motion.

#### Phase 4 spec (2026-10-15)

Stephen, 2026-10-15: "continue Phase 4 ... when done commit and merge." Three lanes in parallel, each its own branch and PR, reviewed by the planner before merge. Mockups: n1-ipad-home, n1-ipad-nav, n1-duo-unfolded and fc-families in the owner's gallery.

**Decisions taken (change any of them):**
1. **Grids:** columns still grow with width (`DynamicGridLayout`, web UX contract), and a full-width tile grid reaches at least 4 columns at iPad portrait width. That settles direction-g.md ("4 columns") against ipados.md ("no fixed ceilings"): 4 is a floor on iPad, not a cap. Caps of 3 on tile grids go. On a window with a hinge (unfolded Duo) the count rounds down to an even number so no tile straddles the hinge.
2. **Chips:** they scroll in compact width and wrap (`FlowLayout`) in regular width. With a hinge, the rail stops 24pt short of it.
3. **Quick Links on iPad and the unfolded Duo** is a floating 56pt glass circle bottom-trailing on section roots (n1-ipad-home), replacing the toolbar button; the flyout row stays.
4. **Sheets on iPad:** every sheet names its size. Viewing and control sheets with tile grids, dials or maps use `.page`; lists, editors and prompts use `.form`. Sheets that bypass `.hassSheet` adopt it.
5. **Home on the unfolded Duo in landscape** splits into two columns on the hinge (n1-duo-unfolded): chips and weather leading, cameras and guests trailing. iPad landscape stays one column (n1-ipad-home).
6. **Light-appearance sheets:** sheets follow the system appearance; pages stay dark on the wallpaper. The sheet tokens (`Surface.sheetGround`, `sheetCell`, `secondaryInSheet`, `separator`) become light/dark pairs, and tiles and module lists inside sheets get light faces (white cell, dark ink; family fills and the lit tile are unchanged). Sheets drawn over a photo or always dark by design (Weather, Login, Location permission, the camera viewer) stay dark.
7. **Off glyphs keep their family** (fc-families): an idle or off bed side draws the Heating glyph (Cooling when its level is below zero); an idle or off thermostat card draws Heating in heat mode and Cooling otherwise. Before this they fell back to neutral grey.
8. **macOS:** out of scope. There is no Mac target (`project.yml`), so the macOS items wait until one is added.

**Lanes:**

| Lane | Owns | Work |
|---|---|---|
| iPad and Duo layout | `HassDesign/DynamicGridLayout*`, `HassDesign/FlowLayout`, `HassUI/App/Shell/*`, `Features/Home/StatusRail`, `Features/Home/HomeScreen`, `Features/Rooms/QuickLinksSheet` (button), grid caps and `.hassSheet` sizes in feature files | Decisions 1–5; `dynamic-grid.md`, `ipados.md`, `duo.md` updated |
| Light sheets | `HassDesign/HassTokens`, `HassModal`, `GlassTile`, `ModuleList`, `PrimaryButton*`, and sheet colours in feature files | Decision 6; journeys gain a light-appearance pass for sheets; contrast audit passes in both |
| Accessibility pass | `Features/Bedroom/BedroomComponents`, `Features/Rooms/RoomSupport` (tile faces), Reduce Motion fixes, `Apps/iOSUITests/*` additions | Decision 7; every `withAnimation` / `.animation` honours Reduce Motion (motion, not opacity); journey launch options for Reduce Motion, Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast; an AX5 + audit sweep over every tab root and main sheet on iPhone, Duo and iPad; fixes for what it finds |

Feature files are shared between lanes for one-line edits (a grid cap, a sheet size, a colour token); whichever lane merges second resolves.

## Dependencies on wave-2 threads

| Thread | Why G waits for it |
|---|---|
| App chrome and modals | G restyles its components; building beside them would create duplicates. Hard dependency for Phase 1. |
| Performance, telemetry and loading (PR #36) | The wallpaper cache uses its image pipeline, and loading uses `ContentGate`. Hard dependency for Phase 1. |
| Home modals, lights and weather | Owns the shared room chip modal and weather; Home lane restyles after it merges. |
| Media, cameras and security | Media and Security lanes start after it merges. |
| Climate and vacuum modals | Security and Climate lane and the vacuum part of lane five start after it merges. |
| Chores, To-Do, Vacation, Solo Trip (PR #35) | Lane five starts after it merges. |
| Code audit and Swift skills | Its shared helpers and the SwiftUI Pro review apply to every G PR. Soft dependency. |
| Simulator capacity gate (PR #30) | All G screenshot and journey runs go through `devcap.py`. Soft dependency. |
| Bug reports and triage | No overlap. |

## How each G PR is verified
- Compiles on the Mac; unit tests and the lane's UI journeys pass under the capacity gate.
- `/swiftui-pro` on the diff before opening the PR.
- Screenshots on iPhone 17 Pro and iPad, each next to its mockup in the thread (attached to replies, never committed).
- The rendered contrast audit passes on the wallpaper and in sheets, including the red and orange text on dense modules.
- Reduce Transparency, Increase Contrast and AX5 Dynamic Type checked on the lane's main page and one sheet.
- Before merge, the PR head tree is compared with current main so no recently merged work is reverted (the PR #36 gotcha).

## Risks
- **Fonts:** the mockups use Inter in place of SF Pro, so real spacing will differ slightly. Compare layout, not glyph widths.
- **Contrast on the photo:** the scrim and dense module are tuned on one photo. If the house photo changes, rerun the contrast audit.
- **Liquid Glass fallback:** iOS 17–25 get `.ultraThinMaterial` capsules. Lanes screenshot one older-iOS run of the shell.
- **Overlap with in-flight restyles:** wave-2 threads are changing the same files now, which is why coding waits for them to merge.
